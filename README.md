# Tait Hoyem

I have three goals in my software development career:

1. Strong adherence to the UNIX principles of software design.
2. Security, privacy, and anonymity of the internet.
3. Accessibility of technology to the visually impaired.

Some of my projects reflect these goals; others are just fun along the way.
